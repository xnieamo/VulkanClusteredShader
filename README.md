# VulkanClusteredShader

Xiaomao Ding, University of Pennsylvania, CIS565 Final Project

### Introduction
This code will implement a clustered forward shader using the Vulkan API. For more information about what clustered shading is, refer to the project proposal ([here](https://github.com/xnieamo/VulkanClusteredShader/blob/master/PROPOSAL.md)) for now. I will update this introductionary part as I work on the project.

### Milestones
1. Implement basic forward renderer in Vulkan
2. Implement clustered shading + performance analysis
3. Anything missing from Milestone 2. + stretch goals as listed in the proposal
